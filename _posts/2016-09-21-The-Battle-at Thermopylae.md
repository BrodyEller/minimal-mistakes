## <center>Prologue</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dienekes placed on his helmet and joined formation.  This was his graduation day.  His entire life was filled with tests.  At birth, he was inspected by a Spartan elder who decided he was fit to live in the Spartan society.  At age 7, he was pulled from his mother and placed into military training camp.  It would be a great honor to graduate.  He vividly remembered the ritual that had taken place in the middle of his training.  Dienekes and his peers were flogged until they passed out.  Their mothers screamed for them to stay awake.  Dienekes won; he was the last one who hadn’t passed out.  Years later he was graduating, and joining the Spartan military.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years following, Dienekes would fight in many battles between the city-states of Greece.  Mainly he would fight against Athens, Sparta’s greatest adversary.  That was, until Persia invaded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 498b.c. and Athens is helping the Ionians revolt against Persian rule.  With Athenian help, the Ionians burned Sardis to the ground.  In retaliation, the Persians invaded Greece, only to be defeated at the battle of Marathon.  Now it is 480b.c. and Persian King Xerxes is fulfilling his father’s plans to get revenge against Athens.


## <center>Chapter I</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked into the room where Leonidas was sitting, I had somber news to tell him. “Leonidas, a scout has just returned form a watch.  He has spotted the Persians crossing the Hellespont,” I said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Persians again? Didn’t they learn the first time?  Take this message to Athens.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned from Athens a few days later with a note from Themistocles, the Athenian political and war tactician responsible for the military victory at Marathon ten years before.  As Leonidas read the note, I could see him thinking.  When he finished reading it, he placed the letter down, stood up, and exclaimed, “I must consult the Oracle at Delphi.”  After consulting the Oracle, Sparta had decided to help the Athenians.  The Council, however, only allowed 300 Spartans to go.  These 300 were hand picked by Leonidas.  Each man chosen had to have already fathered a child.  We had chosen to make our defense at the pass of Thermopylae.  Themistocles had chosen the pass to eliminate the Persian numerical advantage.  While we held the pass, Themistocles would hold the Artemesium straight with the Navy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early morning of the first day, a Persian messenger approached our camp.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Be reasonable.  You are outnumbered 50 to 1.  Lay down your arms and you will be spared.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We would die before surrender,” Leonidas replied.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Then be prepared to die.  Our arrows will block out the sun.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Then we will have our battle in the shade,” I said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were standing in the middle of the pass watching as the mass of Persians slowly funneled into the pass.  By mid-day they had reached us, and we stared at each other.  We entered formation and prepared for battle.  The Persians attacked first, sending a massive wave of arrows screaming through the air.  We kneeled down and blocked our bodies with our shields.  You could hear the arrows bounce off the shields and crash onto the ground.  We stood up and Leonidas yelled.  After the failed attempt with the arrows, Xerxes sent in the first wave of ground troops.  They rushed the line, yet that was a terrible move;  We cut them down before they touched our shields.  The tips of the spears changed from bright silver to blood red.  The Persians pulled back their line, and the damage could be clearly seen without the rush of battle.  Bodies were strewn all over the pass, and Persian runners came to clear the bodies off the battlefield.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not too long after that, the Persians decided to try their strategy once again.  The line pushed up to ours, and we held out ground.  300 bodies worth of muscle were pushing against 100,000 soldiers.  The same effect that had occurred in the last push happened again, none.  This time I lost my spear.  It went down with a Persian soldier.  I had to use my sword until the push was over and another spear could be passed up from the rear.  After the push the runners came back up from the Persian lines and cleared the battlefield.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is when the Persians started getting smarter with their tactics.  They pulled their regular army out and replaced them with the Immortals.  These were a higher class of their military that shielded their faces like cowards.  They had slightly stronger shields and weapons, but not by much.  They were called the Immortals because the moment one man was killed, he was instantly replaced.  They slowly crept up to our line, yet we were ready.  They followed the same tactic as the previous attack had, since they were not used to fighting in passes.  They were used to fighting using cavalry in the plains of Asia.  Cavalry was useless in a pass.  Themistocles had chosen wisely.  As they crashed into the line, we continued using our spears to make them fall.  Their moral slowly crumbled away.


## <center>Chapter II</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time we were on the battlefield of the Thermopylae pass, Themistocles was in the Atremesium Straight.  He was protecting us from the Persian military landing troops behind our lines and making us fight a two front war.  Even though he was outnumbered, he decided to attack the enemy ships.  He timed this perfectly though.  He attacked later in the day, when it was close to getting dark.  This way he could end the battle quickly if he were losing.  He held the Artemesium Straight until the battle was finished.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day of battle, we continued as before.  Our lines did not break for a moment.  A break in the fighting only increased our moral more and more.  It was on this day that Leonidas heard grave news from the Phocians who were guarding the path to the back of the pass.  At the pass of Thermopylae, on path lead around it and would allow the Persians to surround us.  Leonidas was aware of this and had the Phocians guard this path.  The Persians were not even aware of this path until a traitor named Ephialtes betrayed us.  Leonidas decided to send most of our army back, yet we remained.  We pulled back to a wider spot in the pass to inflict heavier losses on the Persians.  We broke ranks and fought valiantly, but we were outnumbered and eventually killed.  


## <center>Epilogue</center>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the news of their loss, Themistocles pulled out of the straight.  The Persians made it all the way to Athens and burned it to the ground, but they did not stop there.  They continued conquering Greece until the Greeks won at the Battle of Salamis.  They then won again at the Battle of Plataea, ending the Persian invasion.
